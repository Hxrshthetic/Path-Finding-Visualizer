# Path-Finding-Visualizer
This project visualizes three fundamental graph search algorithms — BFS, Dijkstra, and A* — in an interactive grid environment.
Users can draw walls, set start/finish points, and watch how each algorithm explores the map step-by-step while displaying performance metrics including:

1. path length

2. number of explored nodes

3. elapsed time

The goal of this project is to make algorithm behavior intuitive through visualization, and to compare how weighted, unweighted, and heuristic-based searches differ in efficiency.
