# Path-Finding-Visualizer
Visualizes BFS, Dijkstra, and A* in an interactive grid. Users can draw walls, set start/finish points, and watch each algorithm explore the map with live stats: path length, explored nodes, and elapsed time. The project helps make pathfinding behavior intuitive and compares efficiency across weighted, unweighted, and heuristic search methods.
